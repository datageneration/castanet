Description = "After losing to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election Hillary Clinton famously blamed 'deplorables' with misogynistic attitudes for her defeat.  Previous research shows that voters' attitudes towards women's social and economic roles did indeed have a strong effect on electoral choice in 2016.  Will this happen again in 2020 when neither of the major party presidential candidates are women?  Data gathered in large representative national surveys conducted over the past four years are employed to help answer this question. Aggregate data on the dynamic political economy of presidential approval in the wake of the Covid pandemic provide additional insights on how men and women are likely to cast their ballots on November 3rd.
